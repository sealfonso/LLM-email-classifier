            - complaint: Negative feedback, expressing dissatisfaction
            - inquiry: Asking questions about product/service
            - feedback: Positive or neutral comments about experience

            - If the matter can be attended by our customer support team with standard priority, set is_urgent to False.
            - If there is something that must be done right now that could affect considerably client satisfaction metric or important business relations, set is_urgent to True.
